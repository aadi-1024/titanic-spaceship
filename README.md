ima make separate repos for each project now mm

got 0.79 as a baseline, not bad
#1 on leaderboard is 0.92 so i hope to get atleast 0.85

hmm adding total_expenses reduces the accuracy ever so slightly, somehow using gridsearch makes it worse??

very slight improvement, up to 0.796 from 0.795 with v2.
